### Conway's Game of Life

## Simple implementation of [Conway's example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) of a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)

# We use here an hybrid method, combining Python on the frontend and C on the backend. This allows easy visualization through [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) with enough performace to generate lattices of linear size ~ 5000. Square domain with periodic boundary conditions are in use.
